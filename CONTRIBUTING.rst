Guidelines for collaboration with FEASST developers
-------------------------------------------------------

FEASST developers collaborate with other scientists to justify developing and maintaining FEASST.
If a developer spends many hours helping a collaborator, then a single citation of FEASST may not properly credit the developer for their work, even if the code used is available open-source to other users.

* Collaborators intend to publish with developers.
* Users do not intend to publish with developers.
* Collaborators may have extensive private conversations with developers.
* User questions are directed to public mail lists or GitHub issues (see `../CONTACT`).
* Developers may spend many hours helping collaborators.
* Developers cannot spend many hours helping any particular user.
* Collaborators get priority on feature requests.
* Feature requests by users have lower priority.
* If you are a collaborator, then you are not a user.
* If a former collaborator wishes to be a user, but continues to contact the developers privately, the former collaborator should tell developers they are no longer collaborating.

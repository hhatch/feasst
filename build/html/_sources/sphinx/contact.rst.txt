Bug reporting
==============

Any and all bug reports are greatly appreciated in order to improve FEASST.

The following checklist is recommended to improve reproducibility so that I can get back to you more quickly.

* Reproduce the issue with minimal example to reduce the complexity, run time and file size.
* Provide all output.
* Provide the version (e.g. bash command "git describe --abbrev=10 --dirty --always --tags").
* Provide the user code (e.g., C++ with int main() or .py).

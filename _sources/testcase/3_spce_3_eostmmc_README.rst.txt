    testcase/3_spce/3_eostmmc

Compute the equation of state and coexistence of SPC/E water in the grand canonical ensemble using flat-histogram methods.
Reproduce the results found in the NIST SRSW:

The SPC/E model and reference configurations are provided at

* `<testcase/spce/srsw/eostmmc/t525/run_*>`_ are example scripts to compile and run muvttmmcspce.
* ``h2o.525K*`` contain results from the SRSW.
* ``colMat`` file with the macrostate probability distribution (:math:`ln\Pi`), potential energy and collection matrix

To compare with the NIST SRSW:

* colMat columns 1:2 with ``h2o.525Kr*.p_macro.dat``

Now, in order to compare coexistence properties you will need to make use of histogram reweighting, as described in :doc:`/testcase/1_lj_3_eostmmc_README`.

=====================================================

Here you can find various examples of FEASST used to reproduce published results, or simply tutorial simulations.

The following files may appear in the test cases.

* ``test.cc`` and ``test.py`` files are the C++ and python interfaces for FEASST, respectively.
* ``run_*.sh`` files are example bash scripts to compile and run.

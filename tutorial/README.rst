The following tutorials are also located in the code repository with the same path as the html (e.g., in /path/to/feasst/plugin/[name]/tutorial/).

Basic tutorials:

Text file interface
======================

The above tutorials feature the text-based interface of FEASST.
The text interface comprises the names of all Classes and their constructor arguments.
Thus, most users will want to search the documentation for these classes.
Documentation for a particular class can be found by searching the `list of all capabilities <../plugin/README.html>`_ (typically, using ctrl-f).
All available arguments for that class can then be found in the list of "args" of that class, or its base classes.

Python and C++ interface
===============================

FEASST may also be called directly in Python and C++ as a `library <library/tutorial.html>`_.
Note that the Python and C++ interfaces may change with minor version.
Thus, the Python and C++ interfaces are not recommended for beginning users.
